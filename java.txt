Effective Java, Nov 2020 re-read:

Assume (and auto?)
import java.util.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.io.*;

1. Static factory methods
2. Builders
3. Enum singleton

public enum Elvis {
    INSTANCE;
    public void leaveBuilding() { ... }
}

4. Private ctor for noninstantiation
5. Avoid unnecessary objects. Careful with object pools; JVM is good.
6. Set obsolete to null
7. Avoid finalizers. Use final block to close resources.

8. Overriding equals is hard: Reflexive, Symmetric, Transitive, Consistent, non-null.
Default uses reference-equals.
Reflexive: x.equals(x) == true
Symmetric: x.equals(y) == y.equals(x)
Transitive: x.equals(y) && y.equals(z) => x.equals(z)
Consistent: same answer always x.equals(y)
x.equals(null) == false

Recipe for equals():
    0. Use @Override. Only use Object as param type.
    1. Use == to check reference-equals
    2. Use instanceof to check type
    3. Cast to type (safe now)
    4. Check each significant field f in class against other o
        (f==null ? o.f == null : f.equals(o.f))
        OR for faster if often equals
        (f == o.f || (f != null && f.equals(o.field)))
    5. Check symmetry, transitive, and consistent w/ tests
    6. Override hashCode
    7. Don't be clever; only check fields.

9. Always override hashCode when you override equals
Equal objects must have equal hashCodes
10. Override toString
11. Judiciously override clone (usually don't)
Better to provide copy ctor or copy factory.
12. Consider implementing Comparable; good for sorting.

13. Minimize public classes and members
Top-level classes can be public or default package-private; prefer the latter.
    Public classes lock you in.
Members (fields, methods, nested classes, & nested interfaces):
private             prefer
package-private     default, good for enabling testing
protected           for super classes
public              only for intentional API

Instance fields should never be public; makes thread unsafe
Wrong to have a public static final array field or return such a field.
    Return a clone

14. In public classes, use getters
15. Immutability good: simple to use & thread-safe
Rules of Immutability:
    1. No mutator methods
    2. Can't be extended; make class final
    3. Make all fields final
    4. Make all fields private
    5. Ensure exclusive access to mutable components by making defensive copies in
        ctors, accessors, & readObject methods

Make every field final unless there's a good reason not to.

16. Composition over inheritence
17. Prohibit inheritence or design & document it
    Constructors must not invoke overridable methods
    Neither clone nor readObject may invoke an overridable method.
18. Prefer interfaces to abstract classes
Interfaces are simpler, less-coupled, less-hierarchial, but once defined are hard to change.
Abstract classes are more complicated, but can evolve easier.

Best of both worlds:
Doer            my interface
AbstractDoer    abstract, skeletal implementation of interface

19. Don't use interfaces to hold constants
20. Don't use tagged classes (classes with fields that indicate their type)
Use actual class hierarchy
21. Function objects for Strategies Obsolete: use Lambdas instead
22. Favor static member classes over non-static

23. Don't use raw types
If you don't know the type, use List<?>

Terms:
Parameterized type          List<String>
Actual type parameter       String
Generic Type                List<E>
Formal type parameter       E
Unbounded wildcard type     List<?>
Raw type                    List
Bounded type parameter      <E extends Number>
Recursive type bound        <T extends Comparable<T>>
Bounded wildcard type       List<? extends Number>
Generic method              static <E> List<E> asList(E[] a)
Type token                  String.class

24. Eliminate uncheck warnings

If you can't, use @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") with a comment
25. Prefer Lists to arrays
26. Favor generic types: public class Stack<E>
27. Favor generic methods: public static <E> Set<E> union(...)
28. Use bounded wildcards to increase flexibility
PECS: producer-extends, consumer-super
For T producers, use <? extends T>
    can produce T or extensions/subclasses of T
For T consumers, use <? super T>
    must consume T or super classes of T
    Comparable & Comparator are consumers; always use Comparable<? super T>

Don't use wildcards in return types.

29. Consider typesafe hetergenous containers

String.class is type Class<String>

30. Use enums instead of int constants
31. Use instance fields instead of ordinals
Never derive a value associated with an enum from its ordinal; store instance field instead
32. Use EnumSet instead of bit fields
33. Use EnumMap instead of ordinal indexing
34. Emulate extensible enums for interfaces
35. Use annotations over naming patterns
Example annotation:
import java.annotation.*;
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface Test {
}

To check:
Class testClass =...
for (Method m : testClass.getDeclaredMethods())
    m.isAnnotationPresent(Test.class)


For an annotation type w/ param:

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface ExceptionTest {
    Class<? extends Exception> value();
}

36. Use @Override on every overriding method.
Can skip for implementations of abstract classes, but probably should still do it anyway.

37. Use marker interfaces to define types
Marker interfaces have no methods but indicate that some class does something.

38. Check params for validity (and doc it)
39. Use defensive copies when needed
    Make the copy, THEN check that the COPY is valid (don't check the originals)
    Avoids time-of-check/time-of-use TOCTOU attack.

40. Design methods carefully
Tips:
    1. Choose names carefully
    2. Don't go overboard with convenience methods
    3. Avoid long param lists
    4. For parameter types, favor interfaces
    5. Prefer enums (two-values) to booleans
41. Use overloading judiciously

Overloaded methods are methods with the same name but different parameters.
Overridden methods are declared in superclasses and implemented in subclasses.

Overloading is determined at compile time.
Overridden is determined at runtime.
Selection among overLOADED methods is static.
Selection among overRIDDEN methods is dynamic.

To avoid confusing overloads: never export two overloads with the same # of params.
(Think how Go does this)

42. Use varargs judiciously
static int sum(int... args) {...} // Here args is an array

If you need to have at least one element, use this:
static int sum(int first, int... rest)

43. Prefer empty over null
Use Collection.emptyList

44. Write JavaDocs for all exposed API elements
Each exported class, interface, ctor, method, and field.
First sentence is summary. Don't use the same summary twice.

{@code your code here}

<pre>{@code your multi-line code here}</pre>

{@literal suppresses html, use for < and > and & }

Document type params:

@param <K> the type of keys
@param <V> the type of values

Ch8: General Programming (These apply for many other languages!)
45. Minimize scope of local variables
46. Prefer for-each loops
47. Know and use libraries

High:
java.lang.*
java.util.*
java.util.conurrent.*

Low:
java.io.*
java.nio.*

48. Avoid float and double if exact answers are required
Use BigDecimal, int, or long for monetary calculations
49. Prefer primitive types to boxed primitives
Unboxing can throw NPE in addition to being inefficient
50. Avoid strings where other types are more appropriate
Use numerical or boolean or enums or aggregate types.
51. Beware performance of string concatenation
More abstract: be aware of the time-space complexity/cost of operations.
52. Refer to objects by their interfaces.
Use List instead of ArrayList
53. Prefer interfaces to reflection
You almost never need reflection. If you do, use it minimally.
54. Use JNI judiciously
It's legit to use JNI for platform-specific features not provided by JVM or to
re-use existing C/C++ libraries.
Rarely advisable to use for performance.
55. Optimize judiciously
    1. Don't do it
    2. (For experts) Don't do it yet -- that is, not until you have a perfectly
       clear and unoptimized solution. -M.A. Jackson

Write good programs rather than fast ones.
Avoid design decisions that limit performance: APIs, wire-level protocols, & persistent data formats.

Measure performance before and after each attempted optimization (TDD!)

56. Adhere to generally accepted naming conventions.

Interfaces end in -ible or -able
Boolean methods start with is- or has-
Methods converting type start with to-
Methods that return a view start with as-
Methods that return a primitive value are like intValue
Other common names:
    valueOf, of, getInstance, newInstance, getType and newType

(End of General Programming)

57. Use exceptions only for exceptional conditions
58. Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and runtime exceptions for programming errors
All unchecked throwables should subclass RuntimeException
59. Avoid unnecessary use of checked exceptions
If they cannot possibly recover, just use unchecked.
60. Favor the use of standard exceptions
IllegalArgumentException
IllegalStateException
NullPointerException
IndexOutOfBoundsException
ConcurrentModificationException
UnsupportedOperationException
ArithmetricException
NumberFormatException
61. Throw exceptions appropriate to the abstraction
62. Document all exceptions thrown by each method
Use @throws for JavaDoc
Do not use throws keyword to included unchecked exceptions.
63. Include failure-capture information in detail messages.
To capture the failure, the detail message of an exception should contain the values
of all paramters and fields that "contributed" to the exception.
64. Strive for failure atomicity. Shold leave in a state prior to invocation.
65. Don't ignore exceptions. At least add a comment in the catch block.

66. Synchronize access to shared mutable data.
Reading or writing to a variable is atomic, unless it's a long or double.
But without synchronize/synchronized, the new values may not be visible to everyone.
Synchronization is required for reliable communication between threads as well as for mutual exclusion.
Synchronization has no effect unless both read and write are synchronized.

private static boolean stopRequested;
private static synchronized void requestStop() { stopRequested = true; }
private static synchronized boolean stopRequested() { return stopRequested;}

For a value that only need communication, but not mutex, you can use volatile.
volatile ensures the latest written value is read. BUT it doesn't provide any mutex safety.
private static volatile boolean stopRequested;

Do not use Thread.stop, it's unsafe

Better yet, use AtomicLong
Best yet, use immutable objects and confine mutable data to a single thread.

67. Avoid excessive sync
Do as little work within sync block
Do not call unknown code within sync block

68. Prefer executors and tasks to threads

ExcecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
executor.execute(runnable);
executor.shutdown();

CachedThreadPools are good for small programs, but not good for production servers.
Use FixedThreadPools instead for prod servers.

Use ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor instead of Timers

69. Prefer concurrency utilities to wait and notify
avoid wait & notify. Use the ConcurrentX collections.

For timing, use System.nanoTime over System.currentTimeMillis

Always use the wait-loop to invoke the wait method; never invoke outside a loop:
synchronized (obj) {
    while (condition) obj.wait(); // Releases lock, and reaquires on wakeup
    // do action
}

notifyAll should generally be used over notify. If you use notify, ensure liveness.
There's seldom reason to use wait and notify in code.

70. Doc thread safety
Immutable is always thread safe, e.g. String, Long, BigInteger
ThreadSafe are mutable but has sufficient sync, e.g. Random & ConcurrentHashMap
Conditionally thread-safe, need external sync. e.g. Collections.synchronized wrappers
Not thread-safe, e.g. ArrayList and HashMap
Thread-hostile, e.g. System.runFinalizersOnExit

71. Use lazy-init judiciously. Prefer normal init.

To break circularity, use sync accessor:
private Foo foo;
synchronized Foo getFoo() {
    if (foo == null) foo = newFoo();
    return foo;
}

For static-fields, init holder class idiom:
private static class FieldHolder {
    static final FieldType field = computeFieldValue();
}
static FieldType getField() { return FieldHolder.field; }

For instance fields, use double-check volatile idiom:
private volatile FieldType field;
FieldType getField() {
    FieldType result = field;
    if (result == null) { // First check-no locking
        synchronized(this) {
            result = field;
            if (result == null) // Second check, with locking
                field = result = computeFieldValue();
        }
    }
    return result;
}

72. Don't depend on teh thread scheduler
Threads should not busy-wait.
Thread.yield has no testable semantic.
Thread priorities are the least portable features.

73. Avoid thread groups

74. Implement Serializable judiciously
Locks in class, increases bugs & security holes, extra testing.
Extensible classes should rarely implement Serializable.
