Got a Spring web service setup with Elastic Beanstalk

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/deploying-a-spring-boot-application-on-aws-using-aws-elastic-beanstalk/

Deployment goes:
1. code stored in CodeCommit
2. code built with CodeBuild
3. hosted on Elastic Beanstalk
4. CodePipeline manages steps #1-3

Challenges:
1. (easy) Getting git creds
2. (medium) figuring out the buildspec.yml
3. (easy) getting the service to run on the right port
